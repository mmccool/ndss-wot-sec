The Web of Things (WoT)~\cite{Wot2017arch} aims to provide interoperability between IoT devices.
It does this by defining a metadata format,
the WoT \emph{Thing Description}, that can describe 
a wide range of IoT network interfaces.
A Thing Description can describe the network interfaces of existing devices
or can be produced and consumed by devices running a WoT runtime supporting a WoT scripting
API that normalizes interactions with other devices with a common abstraction layer.
It also supports semantic annotations based on linked data~\cite{linkeddata2011} supporting
powerful search and inferencing capabilities.
